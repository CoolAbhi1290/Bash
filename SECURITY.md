# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since we do not separately distribute individual versions, security patches will be applied every run time of the game. You do not have to worry about updating as they are pre-managed.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/CoolAbhi1290/Bug-Bash-Public/issues) and [create a new issue](https://github.com/CoolAbhi1290/Bug-Bash-Public/issues/new) for any vulnerabilities you find during run time. You can expect vulnerability patches every week or so depending on its severity and request.
